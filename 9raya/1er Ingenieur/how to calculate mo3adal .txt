Sure, here's a template for calculating the overall average across multiple modules:

    **Determine Coefficients**:
	For each module, identify the coefficient assigned to it.

    **Calculate Weighted Scores**:
        For each module:
            Multiply the exam score by the exam coefficient and the assessment score by the assessment coefficient.
            Add these two scores together to get the weighted score for that module.

    **Sum Weighted Scores**:
	Add up all the weighted scores from step 2.

    **Sum Coefficients**:
	Add up all the coefficients from step 1.

    **Calculate Overall Average**:
        Divide the sum of weighted scores by the sum of coefficients.

    **Adjust**:
	If necessary, adjust the overall average to be out of the desired total score (e.g., out of 20, 40, etc.).

Here's a simplified version:

    **Module 1**:
        Coefficient: [Coefficient Value]
        Exam Score: [Score]
        Assessment Score: [Score]
    **Module 2**:
        Coefficient: [Coefficient Value]
        Exam Score: [Score]
        Assessment Score: [Score]
    Repeat for all modules
    1.Calculate Weighted Scores: Multiply each score by its respective coefficient.
    2.Calculate Overall Average: Sum the weighted scores and divide by the sum of coefficients.
    3.Adjust if Necessary: If needed, adjust the overall average to fit the desired scale.
